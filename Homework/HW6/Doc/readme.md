/*
 * Primary example is mutation testing
 *  1. Induce small changes to the program: mutants
 *  2. Find tests that cause the mutant programs to fail: killing mutants
 *  3. Failure is defined as different output from the original program
 *  4. Check the output of useful tests on the original program
